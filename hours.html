          <p id="para1">Haukai Restaurant specialises in Māori kai and is based in the Bay of Islands. It was started by a couple
            who are keen on creating a business that would appeal to locals and tourists visiting the area. The owners invite customers
            to experience Te Ao Maori with the use of karakia for blessing food. Haukai offers a wide range of authentic Māori and 
            Pākeha kai options and drinks. 
          </p>

          <p id="para1">Our menus change with the seasons. The innovative dishes reflect what is currently in season through locally sourced produce
            from trusted vendors across the <em>Aotearoa!</em> Haukai pairs it's amazing cuisine with the best wine that is locally produced from some
            of the finest vineyards around the country, and offers a wide range of largers and ales crafted from New Zealand's top breweries.
          </p>

          <p id="para1">Regardless of taste, there is something on offer for everyone.</p>
