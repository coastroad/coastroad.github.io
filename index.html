            who are keen on creating a business that would appeal to locals and tourists visiting the area. The owners invite customers
            to experience Te Ao Māori with the use of karakia for blessing food. Haukai offers a wide range of authentic Māori and 
            Pākeha kai options and drinks.

            of the finest vineyards around the country, and offers a wide range of largers and ales crafted from New Zealand's top breweries.
